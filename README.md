## Data Visualization Cohort 7

### Before the start of each week, complete the following steps to load the current files from **GitLab** onto your **local computer**:
1. Open up a Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) in your uofm-stp-data-pt-03-2020-u-c folder inside of your ClassRepo folder. 
	- If you run `pwd` in your Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), the output should be something like this: 
		- /Users/*your_username*/Desktop/ClassRepo/uofm-stp-data-pt-03-2020-u-c
2. Run `git stash` to stash any changes you may have made on your computer.
3. Run `git pull` to pull the new files from GitLab for that week.
4. Run `git stash pop` to get back the changes you made on your computer.
5. Check to make sure you have the activities for that week. If you have any issues, ask a TA.

*Note: The Lesson Plans for each week will be uploaded by the start of the Monday class each week. So if you are looking before then, they may just not be up yet.*
